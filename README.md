# Hi devs ðŸ‘‹
 My name is Adewumi Sunkanmi and I am a passionate software engineer and a lover of music.
 I build quality and user-focused products with Nodejs, Reactjs, MongoDB, Postgres and other skills relevant to my field. I believe anything worth doing at all is worth doing    well, and thats why I embrace deligence and consistency.
