<h3>Uniqueness</h3>
<p>
Advanced knowledge of the internals and inner workings of distributed databases, programming in GoLang, Rust, Typescript, and C++, designing a system based on the requirement(s) e.g selecting between B-tree and the Log-Structured Merge-tree (LSM-tree) based Database, application of Data Structures and Algorithms. 

Finally, I love the activity of reading books and not just technical ones but varieties(this helps increase my range of choices)
